# Qt-plus-Irrlicht

This shows how easy it is to set Irrlicht to a new window and add to an MDIArea, and to use any widget to create an Irrlicht instance from.

This project was setup on Windows, so the linker library path and the include path for irrlicht will need to be set to your own copy of Irrlicht.

From this template example I can now move on to other projects using Qt's powerful UI and the very easy 3D engine of Irrlicht.
